A little snippet where yoou can play and visualise sound, either a pitch at different frequencies or download a wav file.

The interface is in tkinter, visualisation is done in Matplotlib embedded in tkinter and the sound streaming is done with Pyaudio using a different differenct thread. It was a great exercise to combine all this.
