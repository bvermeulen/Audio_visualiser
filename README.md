A little snippet where yoou can play and visualise sound, either a pitch or download a wav file. Once a sound stream is started you can use the same button to play and pause.

The interface is in tkinter, visualisation is done in Matplotlib embedded in tkinter and the sound streaming is done with Pyaudio using a its own thread. It was a great exercise to combine all this.
